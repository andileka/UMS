# UMS
UMS Project

To install the project go to UMS/backend and run 

npm start

go to UMS/frontend/ums and run

npm install

yarn start

And you need to connect the backend with MongoDB

You must first create some groups and then create some users because users cannot be created without groups and the list of groups will be empty if you do not create some before creating users. Try to select the groups after the first one in the list when you create a user because there is a bug when you click on the first group but I did not have enough time to solve it.
